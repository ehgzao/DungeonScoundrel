# 💰 Economic System Analysis & Rebalance

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM (Too Easy!)

### Gold from Monsters
**Current Code (Line 2598):**
```javascript
const baseGold = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 3;
// Result: 3-8 gold per monster
```

**Problem:**
- Same gold for all difficulties
- Too generous (3-8 per monster)
- With multipliers, players get rich too fast

### Gold Multipliers
```javascript
// Relics:
Lucky Penny:    +20%
Magnet:         +40%
Lucky Charm:    +60%

// Permanent Unlocks:
Better Drops:   +30%
Gold Rush:      +50%
Lucky Charm:    +60%

// TOTAL POSSIBLE: +260% (x3.6 multiplier!)
```

### Example Math (Current)
```
Monster drops: 5 gold (base)
With all multipliers: 5 × 3.6 = 18 gold per monster!

Room cleared (bonus): 5-9 gold
With multipliers: ~30 gold

Total per room: ~50+ gold easily!
```

### Shop Prices
```
Heal Full:          15 gold
Small Potion:       10 gold
Weapon Upgrade:     20 gold
Relic (random):     50 gold
```

**Problem:** Players can buy everything easily!

## 🎯 PROPOSED REBALANCE

### 1. Difficulty-Based Gold

```javascript
// NEW SYSTEM (Line 2598)
const goldByDifficulty = {
    easy: Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 2,    // 2-5 gold
    normal: Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1,  // 1-3 gold
    hard: Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1,    // 1-2 gold
    endless: Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1  // 1-3 gold
};
const baseGold = goldByDifficulty[game.difficulty] || 2;
```

### 2. Room Clear Bonus Reduction

**Current:** 5-9 gold
**New:**
```javascript
easy:    4-7 gold
normal:  3-5 gold
hard:    2-4 gold
endless: 3-5 gold
```

### 3. Starting Gold Adjustment

**Current:**
```
Easy:    30 gold
Normal:  15 gold
Hard:     0 gold
Endless: 15 gold
```

**New (GOOD AS IS):** Keep current values

### 4. Shop Price Increase

**Current → New:**
```
Heal Full:       15 → 20 gold
Small Potion:    10 → 12 gold
Weapon Upgrade:  20 → 25 gold
Repair Weapon:   10 → 15 gold
```

## 📈 NEW MATH EXAMPLES

### Easy Mode
```
Monster: 2-5 gold (avg 3.5)
With max multipliers (x3.6): ~12 gold
Room bonus: 4-7 gold (avg 5.5)
Total per room: ~18-20 gold

Shop: Heal = 20 gold
Strategy: Need to kill ~6 monsters to heal
```

### Normal Mode
```
Monster: 1-3 gold (avg 2)
With max multipliers (x3.6): ~7 gold
Room bonus: 3-5 gold (avg 4)
Total per room: ~11-15 gold

```

### Hard Mode
```

With max multipliers (x3.6): ~5 gold
Room bonus: 2-4 gold (avg 3)
